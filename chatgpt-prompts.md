> As a blogger, I'm looking for a quick and easy way to plan my content schedule for the upcoming month. I'm targeting a specific long-tail keyword to improve my blog's ranking for transactional style search terms. Could you please help me generate a monthly content calendar with clickbait-style titles for each blog post?
> 
> The primary keyword I'm targeting is: `Insert the primary keyword you want to create content for`
> 
> Please ensure that the titles are relevant to my target keyword and organized in a visually appealing table that resembles a calendar. Each week should have its own table.
> 
> I would appreciate your response in `Language`. Thank you.

Contributed by [@faroukx](https://github.com/faroukx) 

> I'm looking to create an Instagram post carousel on the topic of "`Enter the Instagram carousel topic`". Could you please provide me with a topic idea and help me generate slide-by-slide titles with exact content examples that I can copy and paste into my post?
> 
> For each slide, please also provide an image that visually represents the slide's content. Please refrain from providing instructions and only give me actionable text that I can use as is.
> 
> Once we've created the carousel, I'd like your assistance in writing the Instagram post description/caption. The caption should be formatted with each new sentence on a new line for readability and include relevant emojis and hashtags. The first sentence should hook the readers without starting with "Are you curious".
> 
> Lastly, please add a separator before moving on to the caption section.
> 
> If you liked this prompt, please like it on the prompt search page so we know to keep enhancing it.
> 
> Thank you, and I look forward to your response in `Language`.
